Workflow for Alfred 2 to add an event in Calendar.

Just type:

`cal [event] at [time][am|pm] [on [date]] in [location] @[calendar name] alarm [X min|hour|day|month|year]`

## Just have in mind some keywords:

at - on - every - in - @ - alarm

## See some examples:

cal meet my mother at 15:00 on 10/03/2013 in ShoppingM @Personal alarm 0 minute 30 minutes 1 h 8 hours

Create an event, using "Personal" calendar, with 4 sound alarms - at the time of event, 30 minutes before, 1 hour before and 8 hours before.

Or just:

cal some important event at 9pm tomorrow

Create an event tomorrow with 1 sound alarm at 21:00

You can omit "at" for "all day event"

## More examples:

    cal event at 14 on 21
    cal event at 14 tomorrow alarm 0 m 10 h 5 days 1 month 1 year
    cal event at 14 on 21/04 alarm 1 d 5 days
